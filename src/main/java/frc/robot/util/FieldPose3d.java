/**
 * Alliance-agnostic 3D pose (position + rotation) on the field.
 * 
 * This class lets you store robot poses in "blue alliance coordinates" 
 * and automatically converts them to the correct coordinates based on which 
 * alliance you're actually on. This way you don't have to worry about 
 * flipping coordinates and rotations in your code - just store poses as if 
 * you're always on blue alliance and this class handles the rest!
 * 
 * Useful for things like camera positions, arm targets, or any 3D objects
 * that need to work on both sides of the field.
